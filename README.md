# IET

This is a website & blog to share with the Internet what our team is up to.

It's built with [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/), a static site generator for React & GraphQL.

# Install

Assuming you already have Node & NPM, install Gatsby's command line tools globally:

`npm install --global gatsby-cli`

# Usage

`gatsby develop` starts the development server. 

Now, your app is running and hot reloading at `localhost:8000` and GraphiQL - a brower interface for writing & testing queries - is running at `localhost:8000/___graphql`.
