### New tools built with open data

- Parcel Viewer: https://cityofdetroit.github.io/parcel-viewer/
  - We know that a lot of our open data users are in search of parcel data, so we built this mapping tool to quickly look up property data like ownership, sales history, year built, and legal classifications. It has convenient features like address search autofill based on our geocoder and toggles to see zoning classifications or satellite imagery.
