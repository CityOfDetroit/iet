## March 2018

### New datasets

Nothing brand new this month! 

A few datasets in our pipeline to look forward to later this spring though: 
- Motor City Match and Motor City Restore program data in partnership with the Detroit Economic Growth Corporation (DEGC)
- Web Analytics for detroitmi.gov
- Restaurant Inspections

### Existing datasets

- Rental datasets better reflect stages of compliance: https://data.detroitmi.gov/browse?q=rental&sortBy=relevance
  - Rental Registrations year to date 
  - Rental Certifications year to date, meaning registered rental properties that have also been issued a Certificate of Compliance 
  - Rental Inspections over all time

### New tools built with open data

Last year we partnered with the Police Department to design and build a visualization tool to improve the usability of [crime incident open data](https://data.detroitmi.gov/Public-Safety/DPD-All-Crime-Incidents-December-6-2016-Present/6gdg-y3kf), especially for groups like community radio patrols who regularly analyze and track crime patterns in their neighborhoods.

Our beta release was picked up by the local media earlier this month [here](https://www.metrotimes.com/news-hits/archives/2018/03/06/this-interactive-map-allows-you-to-see-every-single-reported-crime-in-detroit), [here](http://www.fox2detroit.com/news/local-news/new-detroit-crime-map-shows-when-and-where-crimes-were-committed), and [here](https://www.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/detroit/2018/03/05/map-crime-detroit-police/396387002/).
