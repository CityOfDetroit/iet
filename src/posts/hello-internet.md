Hey there, we're IET.

IET is a team of programmers in the Department of Innovation and Technology (DoIT) at the [City of Detroit](http://www.detroitmi.gov/).

We partner with City departments to build digital tools that solve information challenges. Our projects aim to simplify internal work flows and make data more accessible to residents.

IET stands for Innovation & Emerging Technology for now, but we're on a new year's mission to swap out "innovation" with something less buzzy. Say hello and drop ideas at [iet@detroitmi.gov](mailto:iet@detroitmi.gov).

### How we started

Our team came together about a year ago to "build cool things" with the small catch that there wasn't much of a foundation to build from. So, our first few months became dedicated to modernizing our [ETL tools](https://github.com/CityOfDetroit/etl) (read as tools to *extract-transform-load* data) and spinning up a data warehouse. We also launched our first few apps, which notably included:

- solid waste inspections: 
- crime-viewer: 
- demo-alerts: 
- zoom-nineteen: 

### How we work today

We work in the open and in iterations; we approach projects by identifying a problem, testing new ideas and developing prototypes. We use open source libraries and share our work on [Github](https://github.com/CityOfDetroit).

We're currently excited to be building:

- route-explorer: 
- this website: 

Contributions in the form of feature requests, bug reports and code patches are welcome to all our projects. Find notes on using Github issues and pull requests in our Code Standards repository, or just send us an [email](mailto:iet@detroitmi.gov).

### How we'll be using this blog

You can expect to read about:

- Open data changelogs: monthly updates and revisions for https://data.detroitmi.gov 
- Project launches: posts about tools or apps that we've built and how you can use them
- Code snippets: technical tips, tricks, and cool things we're learning
- Team updates: reflections and occasional job opportunities

Thanks for reading, and more soon.
