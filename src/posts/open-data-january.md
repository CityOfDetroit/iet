## January 2018

Since this is our first changelog, let's define what we mean by *open data*. 

Open data refers to datasets published on the City of Detroit's open data portal at [data.detroitmi.gov](https://data.detroitmi.gov/). All datasets on the open data portal are made available for free under a Public Domain license. 

Each dataset can be accessed in a variety of formats. You can:
- view, filter and search data tables online
- export Excel-compatible flat files
- export GIS-compatible shapefiles
- connect to an [API endpoint](https://dev.socrata.com/?ref=Detroit)

We'll always include direct links to the specific datasets we mention in these changelogs.
